This project is a web-based calculator with two tabs:

1. **GA Calculator**: Gestational age calculator with LMP, EDC functionality and pregnancy wheel
2. **Average Calculator**: New tab with the following features:
   - 3 input boxes at start
   - Buttons to select decimal precision (0, 1, 2+), default to 1 decimal
   - Cursor jumps to next box after decimal input based on precision setting
   - Backspace can move to previous box
   - More boxes can be added if user types beyond 3
   - Average updates live as input changes
   - Support for pasting multiple numbers

When working on this project:
- Keep the existing GA calculator functionality intact
- Focus on the average calculator's smart input behavior
- Ensure the tab switching works smoothly
- Maintain responsive design for both desktop and mobile
